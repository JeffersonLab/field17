Swing Shift Summary: (Dutta, Fomin, Trojer) 
-------------------


4:00 PM start shift with data taking in progress on Gold target
in kinematics IV.1 HMS 46 deg, -1.8 GeV/c, SOS 50 deg, +1.7 GeV/c

4:30 PM MCC takes away beam to do a spot change since the current 
has drifted down to about 45 muA.
We start changing HMS and SOS settings. SOS was a breeze, but HMS dipole
just would not set. After a valiant struggle we call MCC for controlled 
access to power cycle the dipole.
MCC said there was a vacuum problem in the Hall which had shut some valve
which they needed to check out.

We go down but are unable to fix the dipole and since some area had 
> 1.5rad/hr radiation level, we have to leave hall before we can fix the
dipole.

8:00 PM Dipole is back.

8:45 turbo pump on beamline was reset, vacuum at mid 10^-4 now, MCC still cannot
open the valve 3H00B

11:00 PM vacuum gauge reads 2.9 10^-4 but valve 3H00B still cannot be opened.
         The other vacuum gauge reads 5.3 10^-4, this one needs to come down to 4.5 10^-4
before gate valves can be opened.


12:00 Still waiting for proper vacuum
